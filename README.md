D20 Tabletop Readme
===================

Overview
--------

This android app should allow creating, editing and then using D20 tabletop maps for roleplay games 
such as Legend and D&D. In addition, we should be able to include creatures on the map to move and 
track simple statistics, such as HP, initiative and status ailments.

This app will primarily be targetted at tablets, but should ideally work on as wide a range of 
android phones as possible.

Roadmap
-------

The progression outlined for this project is as follows:

 1. ~~Drawing a map on a grid background~~
 2. ~~Eraser function~~
 3. Swipe/Pinch to make use of more map estate
 3. Save/load maps
 4. Pen properties (Colour and Thickness, but 'snap to grid' would be good)
 5. Move drawn segments of a map (This may require some concept of grouping lines)
 6. Rotate segments (Scale if feasible)
 7. Layering - Static scenery, Mobile scenery, Creatures (May be dropped)

From this point we move into creature management. This is an entire area which is still far enough 
away that it can be added to the roadmap when it's closer and clearer.
